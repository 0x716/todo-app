# 📝 Todo App – Fullstack Monorepo (Go + React + PostgreSQL)

This is a fullstack TODO application built using:

- **Go (Gin)** as the backend RESTful API framework
- **React + Vite + TypeScript** for the frontend SPA
- **PostgreSQL** as the database
- **Docker & Docker Compose** for development and deployment

Everything is organized under a monorepo structure to make development and deployment easier.
